# Matrix Inversion by Gauss Jordan Method
Impletemtation of Gauss Jordan Method of Matrix Inversion is presented in two popular languages: python and C++. Some imcomplete programs regarding the implementation of method in C++ by using vector methods and object oriented programming is yet to be tested properly and hence are kept in subfolder 'Incomplete programs'.
